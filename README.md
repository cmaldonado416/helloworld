# helloworld
This is a short description. Hello world!

A little about me:

I like learning new things, and applying my mind to different types of problems. What I find appealing about coding is that there is always a solution that requires commitment, trying different approaches and collaborating with others.  

I like sunsets, nature walks, and keeping life simple. Enjoying the little things keeps me happy, and engaged with others. 

I'm driven by creativity and collaboration. Nothin' gets my mind churnin' like a supportive, innovative team work towards a common goal.

I could go on, but I need to learn how to use the rest of github. :) #nube
